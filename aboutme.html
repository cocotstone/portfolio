 <p style="color:green;"> 6/29/2017: Core 4- THe core 4 is made up of loops, functions, variables, and conditionals. Loops repeat lines of code without having to write it out many times. Functions hold multiple lines of code and turns it into one block. Conditionals control when code runs through if statements and more. Variables are set to values. </p>
 
 <p style="color:green;"> 6/30/2017: A list is a series of unorganized data. I only find it useful if you need some kind of random generator. The smaller groups worked better, because they got distracted less. I think the first group for using list's we worked the best. This is because we were independent, and I like working independently.</p>
 
 <p style="color:green;"> 7/5/2017: <img src="CCAB2CAF-0576-49DD-B703-730FEB4B304B.JPG"> My ideas of robotics changed by identifying what a robot can be. I'm excited to see what hard tasks robots can take over. I'm nervous robots will take over the world. Our group for circuits worked well together because we all had knowledge of circuits beforehand. Next tim we could make a better use of our time.</p>
